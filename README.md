### ABSTRACT
The purpose of many health studies is to estimate the effect of an exposure on an outcome. It is not always ethical to assign an exposure to individuals in randomised controlled trials, instead observational data and appropriate study design must be used. There are major challenges with observational studies, one of which is confounding that can lead to biased estimates of the causal effects. Controlling for confounding is commonly performed by simple adjustment for measured confounders; although, often this is not enough. Rapid on-going advances in the field of causal inference have been developed to deal with confounding based on a generalization of classical standardization. However, the rapid and recent on-going advances in the field of causal inference are factors that commonly lead to confusion among applied researchers. In this tutorial, we show the computational implementation of different causal inference estimators from a historical retrospective perspective where different estimators were developed to overcome the limitations of the previous one. Furthermore, we also briefly introduce the potential outcomes framework, illustrate the use of different methods using and example from the health care setting, and most importantly, we provide reproducible and commented code in Stata and R for researchers to apply in their own observational study. Extensive Stata-code is provided in easy-to-read boxes throughout the article for replicability. R users will find a testing implementation of the methods and additional material in the appendix and at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/migariane/...
